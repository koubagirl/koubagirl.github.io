									I'm passionate about data science, especially in the realm of healthcare.  I am excited about all the ways machine learning is being used to fully understand the onset of a disease as well as disease progression.  Given that diabetes is something a few loved ones are struggling with, I've focused on this disease throughout my coursework.  I'm also interested in SDoH and how that impacts the health of Americans.

										    <h2>Predicting Diabetes Through Machine Learning</h2>

                                        <p>Disease progression and chronic disease progression are something very important to me.  A few different projects I’ve worked on involve “predicting” diabetes.   This project involves using multiple symptoms upon intake to a hospital to accurately predict through machine learning whether a patient is suffering from undiagnosed diabetes.  In 2022, the CDC estimated that there are roughly 8.5 million Americans suffering from diabetes unknowingly.  Given the damage diabetes can do, this is a sobering figure and more needs to be done to change this statistic. My Random Forest model was able to accurately predict diabetes 99.4% of the time. </p>

                                        <p>This project aims to creates a predictive model to assess the risk of loan default by potential borrowers using machine learning.  It uses a grid search and pipeline to choose which of various regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression, work best to predict the selling price of a selected home based on certain features of the home such as median income of the buyer, house age, bedrooms, bathrooms, and more.  This project can be used on any area of the country due to its functionality to assess the data and pick the best model type for that area. </p>

It was one of my first neural networks created, and hopefully highlights the excitement into my entry into deep learning.  </p>

I used US monthly US sales data for five years to predict future sales by month.  Given the seasonality of the sales data (especially the jump in sales at the end of each year due to the holiday season), I found a SARIMA to be the best fit.  </p>

The last step of the project creates a function where a user can select their own images of animals and have the XXX classify them for you.  A fourth smaller project included in this project is a second deep learning technique called a VAE (Variational Autoencoders) analysis on MNIST images. </p>

                                        <p> This "project" is comprised of three similar projects all using Keras deep learning to create convolutional neutral networks.   This project focuses on three different datasets, namely IMDB movie reviews, Reuters news reports, and the Keras Boston housing datasets, each showcasing different techniques for building neural networks.  First, the simplest of  the three projects, is a binary classification where the movie reviews are classified as positive or negative, based on the text content of the reviews.   Second, slightly more advanced, is a multiclass classification example, where short newswires are classified into 46 topics based on their text content.  Third is the Boston housing price dataset which uses features of different scales to predict the median price of homes in a Boston suburb.  </p>

                                        <p>I created a collaborative movie recommendation system using machine learning to help users discover new movies they might like based on inputting movies they already enjoy.  The program asks for the user to input a movie then filters and predicts users’ film preferences based on their movie input.  The final step is outputting the top 10 movies the user might like based on the movie they entered.  I am, at the moment, working on creating a collaborative and content-based hybrid system through the computing power of Google Colab.  I’ll update the code here when it is finished.  In the meantime, feel free to try it out and see what movies it recommends for you!”. </p>
