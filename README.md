# **Welcome to My GitHub Page.**

**Introduction**

Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Michelle Kouba and I've been a healthcare statistician for over 20 years. I just finished a Master's Degree in data science, and I'm excited to spend my free time doing the same thing I've spent the last few years doing -- data science. Only difference? I can focus all my time towards healthcare-related models, rather than a very diverse set of models I've created in my program. I've enjoyed learning a ton about finance, business, text processing, and image classification, as well as things such as how Teslas can drive themselves, and I've been wowed by it all, but my true passion and interest is in the medical field.

**Skills**

- Python (intermediate or better)
- SPSS (advanced)
- R (nearing intermediate)
- Power BI/Tableau (nearing intermediate)
- SQL/Teradata/Snowflake (improving)

**Usage**

This portfolio is meant to highlight my skills as a budding data scientist. My passion is for health-care related analysis and model building, namely as it pertains to disease.

- Predicting diabetes based on symptoms with Random Forest model
- ALS disease progression with a Cluster Analysis
